    <h3 class="blogDayNumber">Day 1</h3>
      <p>Today we had an introduction to JavaScript and the DOM. With JavaScript you can animate HTML and CSS elements such as changing the CSS or the content with HTML. We learned some ES6 variables like const and let, different types of loops such as for loop, for while, and switch. We learned about arrays and objects. We learned that objects have properties and methods, which we can access and create. </p>
    <h3 class="blogDayNumber">Day 2</h3>
      <p>Today we talked about jQuery, which is a library for JS. It makes writing JS and selecting the DOM faster.
