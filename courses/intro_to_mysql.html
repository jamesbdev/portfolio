    <p class="blogParagraph">Today we learned about MySQL(Structured Query Language), which is a system to create databases and manipulate data. We looked at  how to create tables and extract information and how to create relationships between tables. Iâ€™m quite new to mySQL so I found it challenging as was lots of information to take in. We talked about LAMP stack which is Linux, Apache, Mysql and Php. We did an activity where we had to create a new database for a DVD store. I think I will need to go over the material again and do my own learning to better grasp the fundamentals of MySQL. </p>
