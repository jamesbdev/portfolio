  <h2 id="mysql">Intro to MySQL</h2>
  <img src="images/blog/mysql.png" alt="MySQL logo" class="noBorderImg">
    <p>Today we learned about MySQL(Structured Query Language), which is a system to create databases and manipulate data. We looked at  how to create tables and extract information and how to create relationships between tables. Iâ€™m quite new to mySQL so I found it challenging as was lots of information to take in. We talked about LAMP stack which is Linux, Apache, Mysql and Php. We did an activity where we had to create a new database for a DVD store. I think I will need to go over the material again and do my own learning to better grasp the fundamentals of MySQL. </p>

      <p>Today we learned about Email coding using HTML and CSS. It is quite different to web page design because email clients can only read old HTML and CSS so we need to code with older HTML standards. For example, for layouts we should use tables. Also there is no recognition of ID for selecting CSS so we write inline CSS for design purposes. In class we coded a newsletter for the Training Dragon school.</p>
